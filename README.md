# Morphology-Operations-for-Fingerprint-Enhancement
A compact OpenCV/Numpy lab that demonstrates binary thresholding and morphological erosion on a fingerprint image

This learning artifact operationalizes a minimal computer-vision workflow: load → binarize → erode → visualize. It is purpose-built for rapid concept internalization around structuring elements, foreground/background assumptions, and the operational impact of erosion on ridge/valley topology in fingerprint imagery. The implementation is intentionally lightweight for classroom use, prototypes, and pre-production algorithm selection
